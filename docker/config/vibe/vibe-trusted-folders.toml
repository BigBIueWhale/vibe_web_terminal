# Pre-trust the workspace to enable project-local Vibe configuration.
# Without this, users would see a trust dialog before Vibe loads any of:
#   - AGENTS.md / VIBE.md / .vibe.md (project instructions)
#   - .vibe/config.toml (project-specific config overrides)
#   - .vibe/tools/ (custom project tools)
#   - .vibe/skills/ (custom project skills)
#   - .vibe/agents/ (custom agent profiles)
#   - .vibe/prompts/ (custom prompts)
#
# Note: Only this exact path is trusted. Subdirectories (e.g., workspace/myproject/)
# will prompt for trust separately when they contain .vibe/ or AGENTS.md.
